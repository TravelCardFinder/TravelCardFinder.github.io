At **[TravelCardFinder](https://travelcardfinder.github.io)**, transparency is a priority. This Affiliate Disclosure explains how the site generates revenue through affiliate programs and how it may affect users.

## What Are Affiliate Links?
Affiliate links are special links that allow TravelCardFinder to earn a small commission when users click on them and make a purchase or sign up for a service. This does not increase the cost for you.

## How TravelCardFinder Uses Affiliate Links
+ The site includes affiliate links to various travel card providers or related services.
+ These links are integrated only when they provide value to users by offering helpful options or recommendations.
+ All affiliate links are clearly identifiable to maintain transparency.

## Does Affiliate Income Influence Content?
No. TravelCardFinderâ€™s primary goal is to provide accurate and unbiased information to help users find the best travel cards for their needs. Affiliate partnerships do not influence the content, recommendations, or comparisons on the site.

## Why Use Affiliate Links?
+ Affiliate commissions help maintain the website, improve user experience, and support ongoing updates.
+ This allows TravelCardFinder to remain free for users without charging for its services.

## Responsibility to Users
+ TravelCardFinder always aims to include accurate, up-to-date information.
+ Users are encouraged to research and review terms directly on the provider's website before making decisions.
