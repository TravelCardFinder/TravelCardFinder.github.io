## Benefits of the TransferWise Japanese Yen Travel Card

### 1. **Real Exchange Rate**
One of the biggest advantages of the **TransferWise Japanese Yen Travel Card** is that it offers the **real exchange rate**. When you spend money, transfer funds, or convert currencies, you get the same exchange rate that you would see on financial platforms like **Google**. This is called the **mid-market rate** and is often much better than the exchange rates offered by banks or credit card companies, which usually add a markup.

For example, if you're converting **USD** to **JPY**, the **Wise platform** uses the exact rate that you would see on Google’s currency converter. This transparency helps you save money by avoiding hidden fees and markups that other services charge.

### 2. **Low Fees**
Unlike many traditional banks and travel cards, the **TransferWise Japanese Yen Travel Card** has low fees and no hidden charges. You only pay for what you use, and all fees are clearly displayed.
