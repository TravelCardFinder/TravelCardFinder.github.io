## **Currency Conversion at Real Exchange Rates**

Wise uses the real, mid-market exchange rate without any markups. Here’s how it works:

- When you convert your home currency to LKR, Wise charges a small conversion fee ranging from 0.35% to 1%.
- The real exchange rate ensures you get the most value for your money compared to traditional services.

For example:  
If you convert $1,000 USD to Sri Lankan Rupees, you’ll receive the exact amount minus the small conversion fee.

## **Best Ways to Use the Wise Sri Lankan Rupee Travel Card**

### 1. **Convert Money Before Your Trip**
Use the Wise app to convert your home currency to LKR before arriving in Sri Lanka. This ensures you’re prepared for immediate expenses like taxis or meals.

### 2. **Pay for Expenses in LKR**
Use the card to pay for hotels, dining, shopping, and other activities. Businesses in Sri Lanka widely accept Mastercard.

### 3. **Withdraw Cash When Necessary**
While cards are accepted in many places, small vendors or remote areas may require cash. Withdraw LKR from ATMs, staying within the free withdrawal limit to save fees.

### 4. **Monitor Spending in Real-Time**
The Wise app provides instant notifications and spending insights, helping you stay on budget.

### 5. **Avoid Dynamic Currency Conversion**
Always pay in Sri Lankan Rupees instead of your home currency to avoid additional conversion fees.
