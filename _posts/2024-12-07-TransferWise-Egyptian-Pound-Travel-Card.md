## **How Does Currency Conversion Work?**

The Wise card uses the **mid-market exchange rate** for currency conversions. For example, if you convert USD to EGP, you get the same rate you’d see on Google or Xe.com. Wise charges a small fee for the conversion, usually much lower than traditional banks or exchange services.

## **Best Ways to Use the Wise Travel Card in Egypt**

1. **Convert Funds Before You Travel**  
   Load your Wise account with your home currency and convert it to Egyptian Pounds in the app. This locks in the current exchange rate, so you avoid surprises later.

2. **Pay in Local Currency**  
   Always pay in **Egyptian Pounds (EGP)** when using the card. If a store or ATM asks whether to charge in your home currency, decline it. Paying in your home currency results in higher fees due to dynamic currency conversion.

3. **Use It for Small Purchases**  
   The Wise card is perfect for everyday expenses like food, transportation, and tickets. Avoid carrying large amounts of cash, which can be risky.

4. **Withdraw Cash When Necessary**  
   While many places in Egypt accept cards, you may need cash for smaller vendors or markets. Use ATMs to withdraw Egyptian Pounds, but stick to the free withdrawal limit to avoid extra fees.

5. **Monitor Your Spending**  
   Use the Wise app to keep track of your expenses. It shows your spending in Egyptian Pounds and your home currency for easy budgeting.
