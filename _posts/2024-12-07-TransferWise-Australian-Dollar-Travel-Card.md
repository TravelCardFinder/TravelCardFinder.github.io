## **Currency Conversion at Real Exchange Rates**

Wise offers conversions at the **real exchange rate**, which is the rate you find on Google or financial platforms. They charge a small fee (0.35%–1%) for currency exchange. This is significantly cheaper than most banks or currency exchange services.

For example:  
- If you convert $1,000 USD to AUD, you will receive the full amount minus the conversion fee.  

This transparency helps you save money on every transaction.

## **Best Ways to Use the Wise Card in Australia**

Use the Wise app to convert your home currency to AUD before your trip. This allows you to lock in the best exchange rate.

### 2. **Use for Everyday Expenses**  
Pay for meals, transport, and shopping directly with your card. Australian businesses widely accept Mastercard.

### 3. **Withdraw Cash When Needed**  
Although card payments are common, you might need cash for small transactions. Use your Wise card to withdraw AUD at ATMs, staying within the free limit.

### 4. **Monitor Spending in Real-Time**  
Track your expenses and remaining balance using the Wise app. You can also set spending limits for better control.

### 5. **Avoid Dynamic Currency Conversion**
