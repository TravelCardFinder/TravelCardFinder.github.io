The Wise card converts your money at the mid-market exchange rate, ensuring you get the best possible deal. A small conversion fee of 0.35%–1% is applied, which is significantly lower than what traditional banks charge.

### Example:  
If you convert $1,000 to Swedish Krona (SEK), you will receive the amount at the real exchange rate, minus the small conversion fee.

### 3. **Use for Daily Transactions**
