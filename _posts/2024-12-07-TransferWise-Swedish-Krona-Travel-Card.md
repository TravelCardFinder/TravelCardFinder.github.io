## **How Currency Conversion Works**

The Wise card converts your money at the mid-market exchange rate, ensuring you get the best possible deal. A small conversion fee of 0.35%–1% is applied, which is significantly lower than what traditional banks charge.

### Example:  
If you convert $1,000 to Swedish Krona (SEK), you will receive the amount at the real exchange rate, minus the small conversion fee.

## **Best Ways to Use the Wise Swedish Krona Travel Card**

### 1. **Convert Funds Before Traveling**
Use the Wise app to convert your home currency to SEK before you arrive in Sweden. This ensures you lock in the best exchange rate.

### 2. **Pay in Local Currency**
Always choose to pay in SEK when using your card in Sweden. This avoids dynamic currency conversion fees.

### 3. **Use for Daily Transactions**
The Wise card is perfect for everyday expenses like dining, shopping, and public transport in Sweden.

### 4. **Limit Cash Withdrawals**
While the card is widely accepted, you might need cash for smaller purchases in rural areas. Use ATMs to withdraw SEK within the free monthly limit.

### 5. **Track Spending in the Wise App**
Monitor your expenses, set spending limits, and freeze your card if necessary using the Wise app.
