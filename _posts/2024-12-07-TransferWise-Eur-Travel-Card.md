## **Currency Conversion at Real Exchange Rates**

Unlike banks, which add hidden markups to exchange rates, Wise offers the **mid-market exchange rate**. This is the fairest rate you’ll find, without any additional margins. 

For example:  
- If you convert €1,000 to USD, you’ll receive the full amount minus the small conversion fee.  

This transparency ensures you always know what you’re paying.

## **Best Ways to Use the Wise Euro Travel Card**

### 1. **Convert Currency Before You Travel**  
Use the Wise app to convert your home currency to euros before your trip. This locks in the best exchange rate and ensures you’re prepared.

### 2. **Pay Directly in Euros**  
Use the card for meals, transport, shopping, and other expenses across Europe. It’s accepted wherever Mastercard is used.

### 3. **Withdraw Cash When Needed**  
Although Europe is highly card-friendly, some small businesses prefer cash. Use your Wise card to withdraw euros at ATMs, staying within the free limit.

### 4. **Monitor Spending in Real-Time**  
The Wise app provides instant transaction alerts and lets you track your spending to stay on budget.

### 5. **Avoid Dynamic Currency Conversion**  
When making payments, always choose to pay in euros rather than your home currency to avoid unnecessary conversion fees.
