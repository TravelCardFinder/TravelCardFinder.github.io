## **Currency Conversion at Real Exchange Rates**

One of the biggest advantages of the Wise card is its **real exchange rate** feature. This is the same rate you see on platforms like Google or Xe.com. Wise charges a small, transparent conversion fee (between 0.35% and 1%) when you switch currencies, which is much lower than banks or money changers.

For example, if you’re converting USD to ZAR, you’ll get the exact amount based on the real market rate, minus a small fee. This ensures you save money on every transaction.

## **Best Ways to Use the Wise Card in South Africa**

1. **Convert Funds Before Traveling**  
   Load your Wise account in your home currency and convert to ZAR in the app before your trip. This allows you to lock in a favorable exchange rate.

2. **Pay in Local Currency**  
   When paying with your card, always select **South African Rand (ZAR)** to avoid extra charges from dynamic currency conversion.

3. **Use for Everyday Expenses**  
   Use your Wise card for transportation, dining, shopping, and entertainment. Most businesses in South Africa accept Mastercard.

4. **Withdraw Cash Smartly**  
   While card payments are common in cities like Cape Town and Johannesburg, you might need cash in smaller towns. Use ATMs to withdraw ZAR, but stay within the free limit to avoid fees.

5. **Monitor Spending**  
   Use the Wise app to track your expenses in real-time and manage your travel budget effectively.
