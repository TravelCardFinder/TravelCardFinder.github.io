## **How Does Currency Conversion Work?**

The Wise card offers the **mid-market exchange rate**, which is the fairest rate available. Unlike traditional banks or exchange services, Wise doesn’t add a markup. Instead, they charge a small, transparent fee when converting currencies.

For example, if you’re converting USD to MAD, you’ll see the exact rate on Google or Xe.com. Wise’s conversion fee is only 0.35% to 1%, which is significantly lower than banks and currency exchange kiosks.

## **Best Ways to Use the Wise Travel Card in Morocco**

1. **Convert Funds Before Your Trip**  
   Load your Wise account with your home currency and convert it to Moroccan Dirhams in the app before you travel. This helps you lock in a favorable exchange rate.

2. **Pay in Local Currency**  
   Always choose to pay in **Moroccan Dirhams (MAD)** when given the option. Avoid paying in your home currency to steer clear of high dynamic currency conversion fees.

3. **Use the Card for Daily Spending**  
   Use your Wise card for meals, transportation, shopping, and more. Many Moroccan businesses accept card payments, especially in cities like Marrakech and Casablanca.

4. **Withdraw Cash Only When Necessary**  
   Morocco has many ATMs where you can withdraw cash in Dirhams. However, stick to the free withdrawal limit to avoid extra fees.

5. **Monitor Transactions**  
   Use the Wise app to keep track of your spending. You can also enable notifications for every transaction.
