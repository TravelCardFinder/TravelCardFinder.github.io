## **How Does Currency Conversion Work?**

The Wise card uses the mid-market exchange rate for currency conversions, ensuring you get the best value for your money. A small conversion fee of 0.35%–1% is applied, which is much lower than what banks or money exchange services typically charge.

### Example:  
If you convert $1,000 to New Zealand Dollars (NZD), you'll receive the amount based on the real mid-market rate minus the minimal fee.

## **Best Ways to Use the Wise New Zealand Dollar Travel Card**

### 1. **Convert Funds Before You Travel**
Convert your home currency to NZD using the Wise app before you arrive in New Zealand. This helps you avoid high fees or unfavorable exchange rates at the airport.

### 2. **Pay in Local Currency**
Always choose to pay in NZD when using your card in New Zealand. This prevents dynamic currency conversion fees.

### 3. **Use for Daily Expenses**
The Wise card is ideal for paying for hotels, restaurants, groceries, and transport. 

### 4. **Withdraw Cash for Small Purchases**
While card payments are common in New Zealand, some places like small cafes or markets may require cash. Use ATMs to withdraw NZD within the free withdrawal limit.

### 5. **Track Spending with the Wise App**
Monitor your spending, set daily limits, and freeze your card if needed, all through the app.
