## **Currency Conversion at Real Exchange Rates**

Wise uses the **real exchange rate**, which is the mid-market rate without any markups. You’ll only pay a small conversion fee ranging from 0.35% to 1%.

For example:  
- If you convert $1,000 USD to NPR, you receive the exact amount minus the small conversion fee.  

This transparency ensures you always know what you’re paying.

Use the card to pay for hotel bookings, dining, shopping, and activities. Businesses in Nepal widely accept Mastercard.

### 3. **Withdraw Cash When Needed**
